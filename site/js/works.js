My though process of this was very simple, I wanted to draw fruits and vegetables realistically, but that is way too cliche, so I decided to crush the fruits. This not only avoids the common fruits drawings, but it adds to the challenge of drawing the juice of the interior. This drawing really tested my observation use of colors to be able to successfully draw the fruit realistically.'

One of my friend requested me to make a lockscreen of seattle, which was exactly what I did. My friend was happy with the results of the locksceen, and I was able to learn more on how to use Illustrator, so it was a Win-Win! Before giving the lock screen to my friend, I removed some of the raindrops in the middle so that it will be easier to see the displayed time.'
