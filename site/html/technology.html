        <h1>Connection with Me and Technology</h1>

            On winter quarter 2019, I took BISIA 240 <i>Visual And Media Arts Techniques</i>. 
            During that time I was able to deeply reflect with myself on the connection of technology through multiple art projects assignment in this quarter.

        <div class="row">

            <div class="col-md-8">
                <br>
                <p>
                    The art project did not initally center around technology, however I realized that when I worked on these projects, a similar theme of technology rose in my artworks.
                    The objective of this class was to acquire an understanding of how multiple disciplines create knowledge about the world and also gain capacity to develop a new approach in exploration.

            My topic for the first project was on social media.

                    Another project I worked on was creating a clay sculpture representing my identity.
                    The final product is a plaster body cast of my hand with my thumb extended to wrap around the smartphone.
                    Almost every day I would use my cell phone to play games and text my friends.
                    The sculpture represents my identity because I became so attached to my smartphone that it was like a part of me.
                    I wanted to make that visible in my sculpture, so I was thinking if I could make the phone look like an organ attached to my hand, like it is an essential part of my body.

                During my childhood, I was not familiar with digital technology until middle school so reading books was one of my main entertainments.
                When I received my first smartphone in highschool, my source of entertainment quickly switched to texting, taking photos, and gaming on my phone.
                After becoming obsessed with smartphones, I became more reluctant to read because I would rather be doing more fun things on my phone.
                I wanted to show my audience how my life during childhood has changed to a life where I have submerged in the digital world. 
                I created an artpiece where I have folded the pages of a book to shape like a smartphone. 
                This represents that my smartphone, or other electronic devices are a distraction when I try to work on my academics.
        </p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6 "><br><img class="tech" src="../../images/tech5.jpg"></div>
            <div class="col-md-6 "><br><img class="tech" src="../../images/tech6.jpg"></div>
        </div>
        <br><p>
            The connection of me and technology is something I have not deeply though about until I took this class.
            I believe this art projects have helped me prepare to interact with the media and find out what my role is in the digital world.
            Many artists have something they want to represent in their artwork, and most of the time the thing they want to represent is something they have realized through their own experience.
            As a person who was greatly influenced by the shift of analog to digital technology I would like to share these expirence to many people though art and design.
