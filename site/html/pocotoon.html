                <p>Pocotoon is a 2 player game where you must control the most territory on the screen with your color.
                    Your player shoots bullets which will also color the ground with your own color.
                    The bullets can also hit the opponent which will force the player to wait a moment before they can respawn.

                    This game was created in a program called <i>Processesing</i> which is similar to java but is
                    designed to be friendly to beginners that just started to learn coding.
                    This game was made with a group of three, with one who is expirienced with coding, and another who
                    took a coding class for the first time.
                    The game up from scratch.

                    The initial idea for this project was a simple shooting game. 
                    The player only shoots at one direction and tries to hit the enemy on the other side of the screen.
                    However our group wanted to make something a bit more than that. In addition to creating a more creative game, 
                    we wanted to challenge ourselves to code complicated behaviors in Processing.
                    After many days of brainstorming, we settled with a fast paced multiplayer game that we believe is fun and simple to play, yet it is fairly challenging to code.

                    I had a large contribution to this game. Although I was not the best at programming, I spent many hours creating the prototype. 
                    Whenever I ran into a problem, I searched the web for solutions. By the time I completed the prototype, I learned much more coding than what I learned in class.
                    I put many side notes in the code so that it will be easier for my groupmates to read the code and improve the game. 
                    Although the game's quality didn't turn out to be the most visually interesting game. The process of creating this game with my groupmates was a lot of fun
                    and I wish to be able to do more group projects in the future.

                    I do not think this game will be further finalized in the future to be published, 
                    however it became a great practice for me to potentially branch out to game development if I were to gain interest in the future.
                    This inspired me to further work with game related projects whether that is development or design.
